# TCP Client-Server App

Steps to run:

### 1. Clone the repo/unzip the file
Make sure both `TCPServer.java` and `TCPClient.java` are in the same directory. 


### 2. Start the Server
Run the server with a specific port:
Example: `java TCPServer.java 32000`


### 3. Start the Client
Run the client, passing the server's IP address and port:
Example: `java TCPClient.java localhost 32000`


The client will then prompt for input text (up to 80 characters of only a-z, A-Z or empty space).

## Requirements
- Installed Java
- Network access between client and server
